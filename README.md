# Snake-Game-JS
This is a game of Snake built in JavaScript using HTML Canvas for display. Use arrow keys to move the snake. 
The tab icon and watermelon image were drawn by me in Inkscape. The sounds were downloaded from [here](https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/munchin-95618/) and [here](https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/punch-a-wall-82402/), and edited using https://mp3cut.net/.
